    <p>
      FlexDebate’s Public Forum curriculum is centered around adaptation, the single most important skill a debater must master for consistent competitive success. By centering the coaching objective around the locus of judge adaptation, our debaters are able to craft strategies compatible with any judging situation. By emphasizing repetition, contextualization, and fluency, the FlexDebate Model develops debaters’ core skills and topic readiness, thereby giving them the best shot of winning a round, no matter the scenario.
  <br>  <br>
Flex Debate coaching offers all of this at a competitive rate of $2,250 for individual debaters.* This full season of coaching comes at a significantly cheaper rate than what most PF camps charge for two weeks of instruction.

      <h1>Topic Research</h1>
      <p>
        Students will receive a comprehensive topic analysis conducted by our team of elite Public Forum coaches who will outline a bevy of unique positions on the topic, and formulate strategies that will succeed in front of a wide range of judges. Topic analyses give students a leg-up on the competition by familiarizing them to the most common positions on a topic before their first round at the tournament.

      <h1>Core Strategy Lectures</h1>
      <p>
        Students will be offered bi-monthly lectures on topics including, but not limited to, progressive argumentation (theory/K), mastery of first summary and second rebuttal, and perfection of crossfire techniques. These lectures are meant to provide debaters with an in-depth understanding of the crucial turning points of a round and teach skills that don’t just produce more wins on a topic, but cultivate better debate practices at large.

      <h1>Tournament Coaching</h1>
      <p>
        At specific tournaments, students can receive pre/post-round advice concerning particular match-ups, fill in any remaining gaps in prep, and prepare winning strategies catered to particular judges. Flex Debate guarantees access to coaching before every round at a tournament, whether it be on-site, or off-site via our “virtual war-room.”
